# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to our T-SQL repository!

We welcome submissions that fix typos and correct wrong or misleading content. All you need to do is fork the repo, make a single commit with a concise, descriptive message, and then submit it as a pull request.

If you are interested in contributing your own educational content, we encourage you to start your own repo. We would like to maintain this repo as a personal repository of teaching content.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
